Missing values:
There are missing values in 'job', 'education', 'contact'. Options:
- substitute missing values with the most frequent one
- leave the values as missing -> additional category 
- drop the samples with missing values
- (infer the missing values using clustering + polling)

Outliers:
There are outliers in 'age', 'balance', 'duration' and 'campaign'. The options with outliers is whether or not to drop the samples
- I would not drop the 'duration' outliers: a call with negative outcome usually lasts much less than one with a positive outcome. 
  This dataset is highly unbalanced toward the No, so probably the distribution is biased toward 0, making longer calls outliers even if they are not. 
  Furthermore, we are more interested in the Yes than the No, and in the duration outliers the probability of Yes is 60% - which makes sense rationally as well
- I would drop the 'balance' outliers: logically someone with a big patrimony would be interested in investing in other instruments rather than term deposits - or in any case would not take financial decisions over a marketing campaing
  This intuition is confirmed by the fact that a balance outlier has only 9% probability to say Yes.
  On the other hand, people with bigger patrimony have more possibilities to invest. Matter of fact, the probability of Yes is still higher than the dataset average.
  In conclusion, I would test both options 
- I would follow the same approach for the feature 'campaign': there are few outliers and the probability of Yes is below the dataset average. This also makes sense logically: if a person is not interested, they will not accept it no matter the number of calls. Actually increasing the number of calls could produce a negative effect.
  In any case, I would test both options
  Looking at the correlation, actually the outliers have an higher probability of success! 
- As we can see from the density plot, the 'age' distribution is much wider than the two above, and it is in line with the population age distribution. 
  Hence, I would tend not to remove these outliers 


Correlation:
We notice that for each feature there is a correlation between the category and the probability of Yes.
In particular, we noticed that the probability of success can vary quite a lot according to the specific category of the feature.
Hopefully our model will learn these correlations to classify samples
